Want to copy all your notes from Notes into Evernote?

Now you can. Run this AppleScript on your Mac.
All your folders from Notes will also become notebooks in Evernote.

Please take note of these limitations:
1. Subfolders will be treated as first level folders because there are no such thing as sub-notebooks in Evernote. (For clarification, Evernote notebooks in Stacks are not sub-notebooks.)
2. Attachments in Notes cannot be copied into Evernote automatically, so you have to do it manually. Evernote notes that contain empty attachments have its title appended with "(Copy x attachment/s from Notes manually)" where "x" is the number of attachments.
